"""A Python driver for PostgreSQL

psycopg is a PostgreSQL_ database adapter for the Python_ programming
language. This is version 2, a complete rewrite of the original code to
provide new-style classes for connection and cursor objects and other sweet
candies. Like the original, psycopg 2 was written with the aim of being very
small and fast, and stable as a rock.
